 * @file openlcb_buffer_fifo.h
 * @brief FIFO buffer implementation for OpenLcb/LCC message structures
 *
 * @details This module provides a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queue for OpenLCB message
 * pointers using a circular buffer algorithm. Messages are allocated from the
 * OpenLcbBufferStore and their pointers are queued in this FIFO for ordered processing.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Circular buffer with head and tail pointers
 * - Fixed size buffer (LEN_MESSAGE_BUFFER + 1 to allow full detection)
 * - Stores pointers only (actual messages allocated from buffer store)
 * - Full/empty detection without requiring additional state flags
 *
 * FIFO state detection:
 * - Empty when: head == tail
 * - Full when: (head + 1) % buffer_size == tail
 * - Extra slot (+1) allows distinguishing full from empty
 *
 * Typical use cases:
 * - Incoming message queue for sequential processing
 * - Outgoing message queue for transmission scheduling
 * - Event buffering during burst activity
 *
 * This FIFO must be initialized after OpenLcbBufferStore_initialize() but can be
 * used independently of OpenLcbBufferList.
