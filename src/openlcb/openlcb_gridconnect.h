 * @brief GridConnect protocol implementation for CAN message conversion
 *
 * @details This module provides bidirectional conversion between CAN messages and
 * GridConnect protocol format, commonly used for serial and TCP/IP communication
 * in OpenLCB systems. GridConnect is a human-readable ASCII protocol that encodes
 * CAN frames as colon-delimited strings with hexadecimal identifiers and data.
 *
 * GridConnect Format:
 * ```
 * :X12345678N0102030405;
 *  │└──────┘││└───────┘│
 *  │   ID   ││  Data   │
 *  Start  Normal  Terminator
 * ```
 *
 * The protocol provides:
 * - Streaming parser for incoming byte-by-byte reception
 * - Automatic error recovery and synchronization
 * - Bidirectional CAN ↔ GridConnect conversion
 * - Support for variable-length data payloads (0-8 bytes)
 *
 * Use cases:
 * - Serial port communication with OpenLCB tools
 * - TCP/IP bridges for network-based OpenLCB systems
 * - Debugging and monitoring OpenLCB traffic
 * - Gateway applications between CAN and Ethernet

         *
         * @details This function implements a state machine parser that processes GridConnect
         * protocol data one byte at a time. It automatically handles synchronization and
         * error recovery, validating message framing, hexadecimal characters, identifier
         * length, and data byte counts.
         *
         * The parser maintains internal state between calls, making it suitable for
         * byte-by-byte processing from serial ports or network streams. It will return
         * true when a complete valid message has been extracted, and false while still
         * collecting data or recovering from errors.
         *
         * Use cases:
         * - Serial port receive interrupt handlers

         * @warning This function uses static variables to maintain parser state. It is
         *          NOT thread-safe and must be called from a single context only.
         *
         * @attention After receiving true, caller must process the message before the next
         *            call, as the internal state will be reset for the next message.
         *
         * @note The parser automatically recovers from malformed messages by resetting
         *       to SYNC_START state. No explicit reset function is needed.
         *
         * @note Invalid hex characters, wrong lengths, or buffer overflows are silently
         *       handled by resetting the parser. The function does not report error types.
