* @brief Implementation of the login state machine dispatcher
*
* @details This module implements the main dispatcher for the OpenLCB login state machine.
* It manages the complete node initialization sequence by coordinating:
* - Node enumeration across all virtual nodes in the system
* - State-based dispatching to appropriate message handlers
* - Message transmission and retry logic
* - Re-enumeration control for multi-message sequences
*
* Architecture Overview:
* The state machine uses a polling architecture where OpenLcbLoginMainStatemachine_run()
* is called repeatedly from the main application loop. Each call performs one atomic
* operation and returns immediately, maintaining a non-blocking design.
*
* Processing Flow (per call to run function):
* -# Check for pending outgoing message and attempt transmission
* -# If enumerate flag set, re-enter current handler for next message
* -# If no current node, get first node from enumeration list
* -# If current node exists, get next node from enumeration list
* -# Process node if run_state indicates initialization in progress
*
* State Dispatch Logic:
* The process function examines the node's run_state and calls the appropriate
* handler from the interface:
* - RUNSTATE_LOAD_INITIALIZATION_COMPLETE -> load_initialization_complete()
* - RUNSTATE_LOAD_PRODUCER_EVENTS -> load_producer_events()
* - RUNSTATE_LOAD_CONSUMER_EVENTS -> load_consumer_events()
* - RUNSTATE_LOGIN_COMPLETE -> on_login_complete() if set, then RUNSTATE_RUN
* - RUNSTATE_RUN or higher -> skip (already initialized)
*
* Multi-Message Sequences:
* For nodes with multiple producer or consumer events, handlers set the enumerate
* flag to trigger re-entry without advancing to the next node. This allows sending
* multiple messages in sequence while maintaining the non-blocking design.
*
* Internal State:
* The module maintains static state including:
* - Interface function pointers (set during initialization)
* - State machine info structure (current node, outgoing message buffer, flags)
* - Outgoing message buffer (pre-allocated, reused for all messages)

    * @details Algorithm:
    * -# Stores interface pointer in static memory for callbacks
    * -# Links outgoing message buffer pointers in state machine info
    * -# Sets message pointer to embedded buffer structure
    * -# Sets payload pointer to embedded payload structure

    * -# Clears message payload to zeros
    * -# Marks message buffer as allocated (ready for use)
    * -# Sets current node pointer to NULL (no node being processed)
    *
    * Memory Layout:
    * The state machine info contains an embedded openlcb_msg_buffer_t which holds
    * both the message structure and payload buffer. The pointers are set up to
    * reference these embedded structures for efficient memory use.
    *
    * Buffer Lifecycle:
    * The message buffer is allocated once during initialization and reused for
    * all login messages. It is never freed as it is statically allocated within
    * the state machine info structure.
    *
    * Use cases:
    * - Called once during application startup
    * - Must be called before any nodes begin login sequence
    * - Must be called after message handler initialization

    * -# Calls interface->send_openlcb_msg() with message pointer

    *    - Keeps valid flag set (message still pending, retry later)
    * -# Returns true (message was pending, whether sent or not)
    *
    * Message Transmission Flow:
    * The valid flag serves as a semaphore indicating that a message is ready to send.
    * The state machine will repeatedly call this function until the message is
    * successfully transmitted. Once sent, the valid flag is cleared and the state
    * machine can proceed to the next step.
    *
    * Retry Logic:
    * If the transmit queue is full (send returns false), the function keeps the
    * valid flag set and returns true. This causes the main loop to retry on the
    * next iteration without processing any other nodes or generating new messages.
    *
    * Priority:
    * This function is called first in the main loop, ensuring that pending messages
    * are transmitted before any new messages are generated. This prevents message
    * buffer overflow and maintains correct sequencing.

    * -# Returns true (continue enumeration, don't advance to next node)
    *
    * Re-enumeration Purpose:
    * The enumerate flag allows handlers to send multiple messages in sequence
    * without the state machine advancing to the next node. This is used for:
    * - Sending Producer Identified for each produced event
    * - Sending Consumer Identified for each consumed event
    *
    * How It Works:
    * When a handler has more messages to send (e.g., more producer events),
    * it sets the enumerate flag before returning. The state machine detects
    * this flag and calls the handler again instead of moving to the next node.
    * This continues until the handler clears the enumerate flag, indicating
    * all messages in the sequence have been generated.
    *
    * Example Flow for Node with 3 Producer Events:
    * -# Handler called for event 0, sets enumerate=true
    * -# Message sent, enumerate=true detected
    * -# Handler called again for event 1, sets enumerate=true
    * -# Message sent, enumerate=true detected
    * -# Handler called again for event 2, sets enumerate=false (last event)
    * -# Message sent, enumerate=false detected
    * -# State machine advances to next phase
    *
    * This function is exposed for unit testing but is normally called internally
    * by the main state machine loop.

    * It is called when the state machine has no current node and needs to

    *
    * Node Selection Criteria:
    * Nodes are processed if their run_state is less than RUNSTATE_RUN,

    * - RUNSTATE_LOAD_PRODUCER_EVENTS (0x02)
    * - RUNSTATE_LOAD_CONSUMER_EVENTS (0x03)
    *
    * Nodes already in RUNSTATE_RUN or higher are skipped as they have
    * completed the login sequence.
    *
    * Empty List Handling:
    * If no nodes exist (get_first returns NULL), the function returns
    * true to indicate completion. This prevents the state machine from
    * attempting to process non-existent nodes.

    *
    * Processing Priority:
    * The function processes steps in strict priority order:
    * 1. Message transmission (highest priority - clear pending messages first)
    * 2. Re-enumeration (continue multi-message sequences on same node)
    * 3. First node enumeration (start new enumeration cycle)
    * 4. Next node enumeration (continue enumeration cycle)
    *
    * Non-Blocking Design:
    * Each call performs exactly one operation and returns immediately.
    * The main application loop calls this function repeatedly, allowing
    * other system tasks to execute between login operations.
    *
    * Enumeration Cycle:
    * The function cycles through all nodes repeatedly. On each pass:
    * - Nodes in RUNSTATE_RUN are skipped (already initialized)
    * - Nodes in initialization states are processed one step
    * - After processing all nodes, enumeration restarts at first node
    *
    * Message Flow Example (2 nodes, each with 1 producer):
    * Call 1: Get first node, generate Init Complete for node 0
    * Call 2: Send Init Complete for node 0
    * Call 3: Generate Producer Identified for node 0
    * Call 4: Send Producer Identified for node 0
    * Call 5: Node 0 complete, get next node (node 1)
    * Call 6: Generate Init Complete for node 1
    * Call 7: Send Init Complete for node 1
    * Call 8: Generate Producer Identified for node 1
    * Call 9: Send Producer Identified for node 1
    * Call 10+: All nodes complete, state machine idles
    *
    * Use cases:
    * - Called continuously from main application loop
    * - Automatically processes all nodes requiring initialization
    * - Continues operating as new nodes are added
    *
    * @warning Must be called from non-interrupt context
    *
    * @attention Call repeatedly in main loop - this function does NOT block
    * @attention Nodes transition themselves through states - this just dispatches
    *
    * @note Non-blocking - returns immediately after one step
    * @note Safe to call even when no nodes need processing
    * @note If message handler needs multiple messages, re-enumerate the same message

    /**
    * @brief Returns pointer to internal state machine info structure
    *
    * @details Provides read access to the internal state machine info structure.
    * The structure contains:
    * - openlcb_node: Pointer to node currently being processed (NULL if none)
    * - outgoing_msg_info: Message buffer and control flags
    *   - msg_ptr: Pointer to message structure
    *   - valid: Flag indicating message is ready to send
    *   - enumerate: Flag indicating multi-message sequence in progress
    *
    * Testing Usage:
    * Unit tests can use this function to:
    * - Verify current node being processed
    * - Check message buffer contents
    * - Inspect control flags (valid, enumerate)
    * - Validate state transitions
    *
    * Debugging Usage:
    * Developers can use this function to:
    * - Monitor login progress
    * - Inspect pending messages
    * - Diagnose state machine issues
    *
    * Use cases:
    * - Unit testing to verify internal state
    * - Debugging to inspect current state machine status
    * - System monitoring for login progress tracking
    *
    * @return Pointer to internal state machine info structure
    *
    * @warning The returned pointer is to static memory - do not free
    * @warning Modifying the returned structure can cause undefined behavior
    * @warning Do not call from interrupt context
    *
    * @attention Use only for testing and debugging
    * @attention Read-only access recommended - modifications may break state machine
    *
    * @note This is primarily for unit testing
    * @note The structure persists across all calls to the state machine
    * @note Structure contents are only valid after OpenLcbLoginStateMachine_initialize()
    *
    * @see openlcb_login_statemachine_info_t - Structure definition
    * @see OpenLcbLoginStateMachine_initialize - Initializes the structure
