 * @brief Implementation of GridConnect protocol conversion
 *
 * @details This module implements the GridConnect protocol, a human-readable ASCII
 * encoding of CAN bus messages. The protocol is widely used in OpenLCB systems for
 * serial and TCP/IP communication, debugging, and bridging applications.
 *
 * Implementation features:
 * - Stateful streaming parser for byte-by-byte reception
 * - Automatic error detection and recovery
 * - Bidirectional conversion between CAN and GridConnect formats
 * - No dynamic memory allocation
 * - Single-threaded design (not thread-safe)
 *
 * The parser state machine handles:
 * - Message synchronization (finding ':X' start sequence)
 * - Hexadecimal validation for identifier and data
 * - Length validation (8-char identifier, even data byte count)
 * - Automatic error recovery by resetting to start state
 *
 * GridConnect Protocol Format:
 * ```
 * :X<8-hex-ID>N<hex-data>;
 *
 * Example: :X19170640N0501010107015555;
 *   :       - Start delimiter
 *   X       - Extended frame indicator
 *   19170640 - 29-bit CAN identifier (8 hex chars)
 *   N       - Normal priority flag
 *   050101... - Data bytes (2 hex chars per byte)
 *   ;       - End delimiter
 * ```

/**
 * @brief Processes incoming GridConnect byte stream and extracts complete message
 *
 * @details Algorithm:
 * Implements a three-state parser that processes GridConnect protocol data one byte
 * at a time. The state machine ensures proper message framing and data validation:
 *
 * -# SYNC_START state:
 *    - Wait for 'X' or 'x' character
 *    - When found, store ':X' prefix and advance to SYNC_FIND_HEADER
 *    - All other characters are ignored (auto-sync)
 *
 * -# SYNC_FIND_HEADER state:
 *    - Collect exactly 8 hexadecimal characters for CAN identifier
 *    - Validate each character is valid hex (0-9, A-F, a-f)
 *    - Expect 'N' or 'n' at position 10
 *    - On 'N' at correct position, advance to SYNC_FIND_DATA
 *    - On any error, reset to SYNC_START
 *
 * -# SYNC_FIND_DATA state:
 *    - Collect hexadecimal data characters until ';' terminator
 *    - Validate all characters are valid hex
 *    - Ensure even character count (2 hex chars = 1 byte)
 *    - On ';', validate and copy to output buffer, return true
 *    - On buffer overflow or invalid char, reset to SYNC_START
 *
 * Error handling:
 * - Invalid hex characters → Reset to SYNC_START
 * - Wrong identifier length → Reset to SYNC_START
 * - Odd data character count → Reset to SYNC_START
 * - Buffer overflow → Reset to SYNC_START
 * - All errors are silent; parser automatically recovers
 *
 * The parser maintains internal state between calls using static variables,
 * enabling byte-by-byte processing suitable for interrupt-driven serial reception
 * or network socket data streams.
 *
 * Use cases:
 * - Serial port receive interrupt handlers calling once per received byte
 * - TCP/IP socket data processing with partial packet reception
 * - File parsing of GridConnect log files
 * - Real-time monitoring applications
 *
 * @verbatim
 * @param next_byte Next byte from the incoming GridConnect stream
 * @param gridconnect_buffer Pointer to buffer where complete message will be stored
 * @endverbatim
 *
 * @return true when a complete and valid GridConnect message has been extracted and
 *         copied to gridconnect_buffer
 * @return false while still collecting data or after recovering from errors
 *
 * @warning Buffer pointer must point to a valid gridconnect_buffer_t array.
 *          NULL pointer will cause undefined behavior on message completion.
 *
 * @warning This function uses static variables (_current_state, _receive_buffer_index,
 *          _receive_buffer) to maintain parser state. It is NOT thread-safe and must
 *          be called from a single context only.
 *
 * @attention After receiving true, caller must process the message before the next
 *            call, as the internal state will be reset for the next message and
 *            _receive_buffer may be overwritten.
 *
 * @attention The function modifies output buffer only when returning true.
 *            The buffer contents are undefined when the function returns false.
 *
 * @note The parser is designed for continuous streaming operation. Feed bytes
 *       sequentially and check for true return on each call.
 *
 * @note Invalid messages are silently discarded. The function does not report
 *       error types or counts; it simply resynchronizes to the next valid message.
