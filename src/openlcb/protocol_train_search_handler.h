 * @brief Train Search Protocol message handler
 *
 * @details Handles incoming train search Event IDs from the network.
 * Decodes the search query (DCC address, flags) and compares against each
 * train node's address. Matching nodes reply with a Producer Identified
 * event containing their own address.
 *
 * Called from the main statemachine when a train search event is detected.
 * Unlike broadcast time (node index 0 only), train search is called for
 * every train node so each can check for a match.
