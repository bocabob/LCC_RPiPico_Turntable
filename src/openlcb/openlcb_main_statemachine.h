* @brief Main OpenLCB protocol state machine interface and dispatcher
*
* @details This file defines the main state machine dispatcher for processing
* OpenLCB protocol messages. It provides a central message routing mechanism
* that dispatches incoming messages to appropriate protocol handlers based on
* Message Type Indicator (MTI) values.
*
* The state machine operates on a node enumeration model, processing each
* incoming message against all active nodes in the system. Protocol handlers
* are provided through function pointers in the interface structure, allowing
* flexible implementation of required and optional OpenLCB protocols.
*
* Key responsibilities:
* - Message routing and MTI-based dispatch
* - Node enumeration and message filtering
* - Outgoing message queue management
* - Protocol handler invocation
* - Interaction rejected message generation
*
* Supported protocols (via interface callbacks):
* - Message Network Protocol (required)
* - Protocol Support Protocol/PIP (required)
* - Simple Node Information Protocol/SNIP (optional)
* - Event Transport Protocol (optional)
* - Train Protocol (optional)
* - Datagram Protocol (optional)
* - Stream Protocol (optional)

     * @brief Dependency injection interface for OpenLCB Main State Machine operations
     *
     * @details This structure defines all function pointers required and optional
     * for the main OpenLCB protocol dispatcher. The application must populate this
     * structure with appropriate callbacks before calling OpenLcbMainStatemachine_initialize().
     *
     * OpenLcbCLib uses dependency injection to enable:
     * - Comprehensive unit testing with mock implementations
     * - Protocol-specific optimization (NULL handlers strip unused code)
     * - Flexible application integration
     * - Platform-independent operation
     *
     * Function pointers are organized into categories:
     * - Resource management: Lock/unlock shared resources, message transmission
     * - Node enumeration: First/next node iteration for multi-node support
     * - Required protocol handlers: Message Network and Protocol Support (PIP)
     * - Internal handlers: Exposed for testing and debugging
     * - Optional protocol handlers: SNIP, Events, Train, Datagram, Stream
     *
     * Required vs Optional handlers:
     * - Required handlers MUST be non-NULL and properly implemented
     * - Optional handlers may be NULL if protocol not supported by node
     * - When optional handler is NULL, dispatcher automatically sends Interaction Rejected
     * - This allows minimal nodes to omit unnecessary protocol support
     *
     * Handler invocation flow:
     * -# Main loop pops incoming message from FIFO
     * -# Enumerate all nodes in system
     * -# For each node, check if message applies (broadcast or addressed to node)
     * -# Dispatch to handler based on MTI value
     * -# Handler processes message and optionally prepares response
     * -# Response queued for transmission
     *
     * Use cases:
     * - Application initialization and configuration
     * - Dependency injection for comprehensive testing
     * - Protocol selection and node capability customization
     * - Platform-specific integration
     *
     * @warning ALL required function pointers MUST be non-NULL or undefined behavior occurs
     * @warning Optional pointers can be NULL to disable specific protocols
     * @warning Handlers must not block - use cooperative multitasking patterns
     *
     * @attention Populate all required fields before calling OpenLcbMainStatemachine_initialize()
     * @attention Ensure thread safety in lock/unlock implementations
     * @attention Handlers receive state machine context via openlcb_statemachine_info_t pointer
