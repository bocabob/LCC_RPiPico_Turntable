    * @brief Interface structure for Event Transport protocol callbacks
    *
    * @details This structure defines the callback interface for handling OpenLCB
    * Event Transport protocol notifications. It contains function pointers for
    * receiving notifications about producer and consumer events on the OpenLCB network
    * as defined in the OpenLCB Event Transport Protocol specification.
    *
    * The interface allows the application layer to receive notifications about:
    * - Consumer event identifications and state changes
    * - Producer event identifications and state changes
    * - Event learn/teach operations
    * - Producer/Consumer event reports (with or without payload)
    *
    * All callback functions are optional and may be set to NULL if the application
    * does not need to handle that particular event type. The protocol layer will
    * check for NULL before invoking any callback.
    *
    * @note All callbacks are optional - can be NULL if notification is not needed
    * @note Callbacks receive the node context and event ID that triggered the notification
    * @note Callbacks are invoked from within the protocol handler - keep processing brief
    * @note Callbacks must not block or perform lengthy operations
    *
    * @see ProtocolEventTransport_initialize - Registers this interface with the protocol
    * @see openlcb_node_t - Node context structure
    * @see event_id_t - Event identifier type
