 * @brief Implementation of the Alias/NodeID mapping buffer
 *
 * @author Jim Kueneman
 * @date 17 Jan 2026
 *
 * @details This module implements a fixed-size buffer that maintains the bidirectional
 * mapping between OpenLCB 48-bit Node IDs and their corresponding 12-bit CAN aliases.
 * The implementation uses a simple linear search strategy suitable for small to medium
 * buffer sizes (typically 8-16 entries).
 *
 * Internal design:
 * - Single static buffer instance (_alias_mapping_info)
 * - Linear array storage (not hash table or tree)
 * - Empty slots marked by alias = 0 and node_id = 0
 * - First-fit allocation strategy
 * - Node ID uniqueness enforced (one alias per Node ID)
 * - Duplicate alias detection flag support
 *
 * Performance characteristics:
 * - Register: Linear search for empty slot or existing Node ID
 * - Find by alias: Linear search through buffer
 * - Find by Node ID: Linear search through buffer
 * - Unregister: Linear search with early termination
 * - Initialize/Flush: Iterates through all entries
 *
 * Thread safety:
 * - NOT thread-safe. All functions assume single-threaded access.
 * - Caller must provide external synchronization if needed.

 * The function implements two behaviors:

 *
 * This design ensures that each Node ID can only have one alias in the buffer,

 * - Updating an alias after conflict resolution
 * - Storing remote node alias/Node ID pairs learned from AMD frames

 *

 *          value before dereferencing. Dereferencing NULL will cause immediate crash.
 *
 * @warning Returns NULL if CAN Alias is outside valid 12-bit range (0 or > 0xFFF).
 *          OpenLCB CAN protocol requires aliases in range 0x001-0xFFF. Zero is
 *          reserved to mark empty buffer slots.
 *
 * @warning Returns NULL if OpenLCB Node ID exceeds 48-bit range (0 or > 0xFFFFFFFFFFFF).
 *          Valid OpenLCB Node IDs are 48-bit values from 0x000000000001-0xFFFFFFFFFFFF.
 *          Zero is reserved as "no valid Node ID assigned".
 *
 * @warning If an OpenLCB Node ID already exists in the buffer, its previously registered
 *          CAN Alias is silently replaced with the new one. This is correct behavior for
 *          alias updates after conflict resolution but could mask programming errors.
 *
