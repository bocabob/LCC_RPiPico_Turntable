 * Implements the core buffers for normal, snip, datagram, and stream length buffers.
 * The FIFO and List buffers are arrays of pointers to these core buffers that are 
 * allocated and freed through access.  The CAN Rx and 100ms timer access these buffers
 * so care must be taken to Pause and Resume those calls if the main loop needs to 
 * access the buffers.
